# NLP-Part-of-Speech-Tagging-with-Viterbi-Algorithm

Description:

This project implements a Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging system using the Viterbi algorithm for natural language processing. It efficiently assigns grammatical categories to words in sentences, enhancing accuracy in various applications. The model is trained on annotated corpora, with a focus on contextual nuances. The algorithm's efficiency and accuracy make it suitable for diverse linguistic contexts.

Key Components:

Corpus Analysis: Extracts linguistic patterns from annotated corpora for model training.

Model Training: Utilizes the Viterbi algorithm to compute probable POS tag sequences, considering emission and transition probabilities.

Implementation: Efficiently assigns POS tags to words in input sentences.

Evaluation: Rigorous testing ensures high precision and recall, refining the model for improved performance.

Expected Outcomes:

Accurate and context-aware POS tagging system.
Enhanced performance over traditional methods.
Integration potential for diverse natural language processing applications.
